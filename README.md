The clients for the DrivePass project are Liam who is the owner of DrivePass and his IT officer Ian. They wanted us to create them a website for students to be able to make accounts and take online classes, practice test, and schedule on the road training. They also wanted to be able to track the data and for the system to be cloud based.
I think that I explained the wants of the clients well and how to handle those requirements for the system.
If i could go back and revise my projects then I would be a little more detailed in them when explaining the system and make sure that I listed everything that is needed.
I read carefully through what the clients wanted to find the requirements they had for the system then planned out how to implement them in a way where they can all work together while adding in the systems so that the user can interact easily with the system. I think that it is important to interpret the users needs because it keeps you from missing key elements of the system like how the user will actually interact with it and if it is easy for them or not.
I approach designing software by first finding out what the requirements are then planning my designs around those requirements, even if there is a little more freedom on a project i still think making a plan beforehand is the best bet.
